# FlipSym
Tool for flipping image and co-registering to self for lesion identification

# Inputs
    1. Image(s) to be processed individually. Can apply to batch sequentially

# Outputs
    1. Co-registered un-flipped image
    2. Co-registered flipped image
    3. Subtraction map of mirror voxel from original voxel
